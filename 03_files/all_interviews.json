        "question": "Can you briefly walk us through your personal background and your professional background so we can learn a little bit about how you ended up where you are right now?",
        "question_summary": "Ask for personal and professional background and path to current role.",
        "answer": "Absolutely. So I actually am born in Germany in Westphalia Sauerland, where Friedrich Merz is from too. Grew up there 10 years. But my parents, especially my dad, as an English history teacher, is one of the biggest Anglophiles. And so by the way, this is kind of interesting. Never again something like the Nazis, that was his thing becoming a teacher way back then. And it is again very relevant today and maybe for your project as well. So that if you like, as a cultural value background has been for me in terms of how I am in the world and maybe what I see and what is important, I think that would have been a strong determiner. We went when I was 10, we went to Sydney, Australia for six years where I grew up and I hope I learned some humor, but also parts of the sort of open new world approach to life and to trying new things, which I think again is really important. I learned things like how to sail there and stuff like that. Normally I probably wouldn't have done a lot of those things and to surf if I'd hadn't been for stuff like that. For the Australians. I finished high school in Germany and then I did, maybe relevant in the time today, I was a conscientious objector. So I did 20 months there in terms of I consider myself a peacenik, but I then studied economics in Freiburg and also did a PhD in economics, which was already the intersection of economics or society and information technology. And at the time already we studied all kinds of things like AI and transportation, telematics and e-commerce and all kinds of great topics that were around electronic payment systems. So a lot of those topics actually have been around. I consider that a great benefit that I got to do that at that point in time. When I was done with that, this would be about 98. I then joined ASAP, but I didn't join them here, but in Silicon Valley, in Palo Alto. And from there on, I was about 25 years in California. I still am there months of the year. And so I kind of alternate, but most of the times in Germany now, after 12 years of SAP, more and more I was getting into startups. And it's interesting, you know, if I hadn't gone to Silicon Valley and if I hadn't been with SAP, which by the way, in terms of a career, you know, I was an economist, if you like, an academic. But there I turned into being a product manager, a job that I didn't know existed. And I think it's a fabulous job. And it just goes to show some, you know, where you end up, you don't know. But so I got more into more being into innovation, being a product builder, also into being marketing from product management to product marketing into actually VP of marketing. And I still like that a lot. The sense of category shaping, the sense of creating new categories. The examples that are thrown around in Silicon Valley which I think you know, can be a big part of also in Germany is like Germans maybe are intimidated of what happens over in Silicon Valley and things like that. So, to get to the last phase, basically through more and more startups. About 2017, I founded my own company. Philosophically, that also had to do with not wanting to be top down software like SAP and other software where the system knows, but designing something from the get go, which is bottom up, so it's around an elastic workflow if you like. It's about process management. It's about anyone having an accessible visual way of designing easy processes. We were not successful in the many sectors and we finally settled on education because the discrepancy there between sort of the teacher who stands at the front and who sucks the life out of the lesson by dominating the process and the people having to sit there being passive, is one of the biggest is one of the biggest hurdles that I see nowadays, still in terms of young people getting a great start into life, the dynamic component of learning by themselves is lacking and I think in Germany especially lacking because they are specially good at having discipline and the top down system. And so the software now we have basically we have relocated to Germany actually had to do not because we thought the environment here was easier but because also we had great contacts through Berlin and into education partners and for the last two years about we've been active here through the Founders Foundation, which you know, we got into an incubator program there and through that in Nord Rhine Westphalia we've been quite successful in building out something which also then went into a model project with 14 schools, about 25,000 students, which is really around a setting of educators, technology. It's called valuable agile learning for all. So it's really about - Can learning being an agile project based learning be valuable so that it's not like an add on nice to have, but it's part of the regular plan? Like one day a week",

        "question": "How much do regulations influence your business model, and has that influence changed over time?",
        "question_summary": "Reg regulatory influence on the business model and its evolution over time",
        "answer": "I believe the regulatory environment or the way the system is set up, if you like, which means that the federal you know system and then also the federal is what I mean and then they also so they pay the teachers, but the schools are paid for by the communities and you know, so everyone's paying. So the system is really impermeable. It is not possible. It's like rock, it is set in stone. And I would say nobody in the system is paid to, for instance, do digitization. I think the all the concepts around how to do better have been around for many decades. I'll give you an example. The labour scholar in Bielefeld has been around now 50 years, and they've already implemented all the things about project based learning and everything that you need to do, which would be great for kids, for all the kids to have nowadays. But it's remained, it's one school within all of North Rhine Westphalia and the German schools, so the system is absolutely not to be changed and any start up that tries to change it is doomed to fail. And so, for instance, even with the backing of the Founders Foundation being a model project finance partially by the state itself, it is not possible to get in touch with the Bildungsministerium [Ministry of Education]. The Ministry of Education in Nord Rhine Westphalia, even though there's politicians from the CDU and the Green Party saying, please talk to these guys, it's not happening and we have business models that show that just on the Berufskollege, if that means something to you. There's 360 in Nord Rhine Westphalia 500,000 students. The schools that we work with, they have failure rates or dropout rates up to 40-50% in the year 11. Now €11,000 per student per year is about the cost, so they are losing about 2 billion per year. There's a tremendous inefficiency, and yet nobody wants to talk to us. So there's a lot of talk now, you could say what has changed in the system in the last years. Maybe the talk is getting louder about the crises, the numbers are certainly getting worse and my firm belief is that through social media and people being extremely passive, I think the last 10-15 years have made the situation actually much worse. It's not just super diversity and these kind of things and artificial intelligence coming. I think the situation in schools with students being like completely in themselves, easy dopamine verses hard dopamine is making it even harder. So back to the regulatory environment, there's no changes that are discernible and I would have stopped based on that, except for I, I do believe the system is incredibly ripe for change and there are those schools that we are allowed to or able to work with. And actually schools have a certain amount of freedom and of course, there's now Startchancen program and there's the Digitalpakt too. So there is a chance, I think if you do it right and it's based on technology because it's never been tried before, project based learning based on technology really done well then school by school it is possible to get through, but not because the regulatory environment is helping, but maybe at least it's not getting in the way as forcibly as it used to.",

        "question_summary": "Asks how the business operates and future strategy, and whether planning accounts for it.",
        "answer": "We maybe have to spell out what you are getting at there more so in terms of being remote. For instance, the company is very remote. I could have we could have settled in Bielefeld, but we went to Berlin. It's the center, it's where innovation maybe happens, it's being close to certain areas there. In terms of for us, we believe like I just tried to explain that what we are doing - getting people to work together to solve goals on a simple level is what they have lost. And so we believe now that has strengthened our or makes our model more, we actually provide even more important than before. I don't think that's where you were going, but. Just recently and I'm super happy next. I'm talking now to Brigitte Mourn of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, very important person and but many people are stepping up. Verena Pauster is another one who are saying that, you know the AfD is happening. The political situation is just really descending really fast. There has to be something that we can do, we are losing these generations and out of the political discourse, or they can go any kind of directions, the whole stability, economically and otherwise we’re losing, and so I think they're very open to maybe changes happening and so we are talking about something like that and with the newspaper also like a project based way of the students really doing their own newspaper and figuring it out - Tiktok, whatever. But really, using the new generation to help us figure some of this stuff out.  But so in that sense, we are, I think, right in the middle of that trying to solve that. But I think overall politics in Germany is, I don't know. If on a level of one to 10, I'd say it's an 8 or 9 behind. Understanding that and there's something I like to quote was in the Guardian recently. I could look it up for you, but. The Democrats in the US have completely missed it. They're still trying to sort of, you know, the Republicans are trying to go back into the 20th century. The Democrats are not able to figure out the 21st where people are online, and if you don't do that, and I in terms of the politics, I think especially the SPD and the CDU are just reacting in a reflexive way that the way they've done in the last 50 years and it's sort of like, well, we have to the way we divide money is more SPD is like, OK, and they said, well, we have to do more economics or something, but, I don't think they really have anything interesting to offer in terms of, OK, like how do we use AI? I think that's a really interesting question in terms of bureaucracy and what we could solve.  So maybe I don't know if that was your question. I think there's a huge potential for Germany to show and political parties also to show there are solutions that can be built and that can help us and that we here in Germany can build. And we have the young people to do that with, but they the politics is the way the way they think it's, I find it amazing that they, I'll pick on Schultz if you like, but I don't think he's arrived yet. In this sort of decade, and I don't hear anything that he's saying, which is like really a solution, I don't think Merz has either.",

But in terms of trying to change, for instance, the political environment around education. I've tried. I've offered it like in Nord Rhine Westphalia, like I mentioned, there's no interest and all that they offer you is oh, that's nice, but they don't, there's nobody that's paid to actually do that or help you. There's nobody paid to do digitization, so there's no one who's actually asking, there's nobody actually interested and so, but would I go into politics? You know I can't afford to.

It's terrible right now, so to be able to just provide examples of that to maybe it doesn't have to be funding, but it can be funding for certain areas to go forward uh for entrepreneurs, for companies to be involved, I think is highly advantageous. We do some of that work. We have founded to work well. There's no where the companies then try to influence the students and stuff like that. They're very good about that. This schools maintain the overall control of everything. So it's it's all in a good way. Absolutely.

Companies can be anything can be politics, communal systems can be green, whatever it is, but that the young people see hey, there's actual real challenges to be solved and you know, let me try.

But in terms of opening up to innovation, clearly Germans are well known to be naysayers. You know, you come up with something and they're like these five reasons it's not going to work. And some of that is good because then it leads to higher quality. But to make it more open towards and everyone participating more in some form of innovation and seeing them to be innovative and curious, I think could be one of the biggest things that would make this country benefit tremendously. I just go back to this also the study of the Friedrich Naumann Stiftung that was quoted to me. And it it really showed the way that economics or entrepreneurship is taught in schools. The books that are used are like 30 years old. And it's like the company or companies are often they sound like they're rather mean or bad or something. And then if the problem arises, it's like, well, now it's that you have to call the government. And so this whole sense",

        "answer": "I would absolutely agree. The only question is how, what are the models, what are the formats to do that? I think we have a good one. I think to bring that into so entrepreneurship, like you were also said, like a mindset and even be less than that and use a different word for it maybe. It's not about the company like we worked with Nifty, if you know them and others who's like, you know, I get all that and start up teams, but it's always like the Champions League of oh, you have to found like these kids and they start, they find an idea and they start a company. No, what about if it's like on the Kreisklasse [district class] that everyone becomes and gets to and don't even call it entrepreneurship, call it self-confidence in being able to do things and from that then I think the financial financing is not that relevant. If it's VC money, if it's Angel money, if it's spin off here there wherever it doesn't matter so much. The whole question is, you know, can you just let people be in the - hey, we can change things up, self-efficacy. And there was a study done, 2018 was Pisa with 15 year olds and the Germans were at the last place, in terms of only 60% thought that they could make an impact on the world's problems. It was the saddest thing that I could see and to change that around to just let them accomplish something together in teams. I think that's one of the biggest things that we could do. So, companies, if we find the right model, I think they can, for instance, the ones we work with, they sort of OK - here's 5 challenges that we have. Solve this for us, right?

That is interesting for the companies as well. I think that's also been the problem. Whenever you've had schools and companies interact, it never worked. It was like, oh, there was a teacher, they tried something, they met, but no, there was no result. The students experience was bad. The company's experience was bad.

So if there's a way that, because as a politician, I understand you don't want to sort of say, OK, this technology, this company should win. You don't want to pick winners. I get that. But on the other hand, it's like sometimes there's highly regulated areas which are correctly highly regulated, like medicine and like schools, you don't want to open that up, but. In those cases, at least allow certain areas where you can experiment in a way and allow companies to show themselves or concepts. And that seems to be something that's left to foundations, and I think it's a very haphazard way. And even now what I fear is like you have startchancen [start opportunities]. 33:00 And so I think there's 20 Billion EUR spent. But then the schools, because they are clueless. I mean, every school is now picking something and then they'll follow the big trend and it's not going to be very intelligent decision, whereas if you had maybe certain areas. Anyway, so that's something having more of these, maybe test beds in highly regulated areas would work. That's just an idea, but for me as an entrepreneur I can say, of course bureaucracy is an issue. I can give you examples. That it's not made easy to just exist and the Germans have a way of also being right about everything. So I could give you examples also of comparing like with in the US if you want to have an advisor. There's great advisors out there, great people who will actually pay forward and do good things for you. And then you just, there's an agreement for that and then they get a part of your company and it's OK. But here there's so many like tax implications and things like that. And then also if you wanna hire someone here, just to get started and to try it out, then that's not gonna go because then immediately like their employee -what does that mean in terms of taxes? So to get to the level of even starting anything at all there's already a big sort of - It has to be done right and you have to follow all the rules and to do that is basically impossible for most people. So that's something. I don't know how you create the environment for that, but it's always gonna be a huge like Cliff.

        "question": "So first just some background information. Could you please briefly describe your background and what led you to start your company?",
        "question_summary": "Ask about personal background and motivation for founding the company.",
        "answer": "Let me. Well. OK. So the company has not yet started. We're still in the founding process. So does that count? So I'm a chemist by training. And I've been in research for the first couple of years of my career. Went into the private sector. And from the private sector, I switched back into this... well into the Fraunhofer world, which is sort of the limbo between private and public research. So, I mean, many people perceive us as just the same thing. As any other university. Very many, even in Germany, confuse us with Max Planck Institute or Helmholtz Institute. But actually, Fraunhofer was designed to act as the link between academic research and applied research, which a company would typically need. So are you familiar with the TRL scale, the Technology Readiness Level scale? So yeah. NASA came up with it and they classified all technology into readiness levels from zero being nonexistent. Up to 9, which is a serial production stage. And so academic research is typically... Placed in at TRL, Zero to Three, so TRL Three is typically... I have a patent, I have a peer-reviewed paper. So you have any kind of proof of concept, but usually in a laboratory environment. And Fraunhofer was basically invented or was founded to cover TRL levels 4 to 6, because that's the valley of death, the valley of risk for the companies. Because there are many companies who probably read a paper by a university. Then we had some kind of trade fair where the university says, \"Oh, look, I have 3 grams of a particular material and I think It's going to be an absolute blast” and when the company asks them, \"Well, I would need 300 tons of it,\" they say, \"Ah, you know...\" So far, we're basically trying to bridge this valley to provide people not just with three grams of something, but probably with 300 grams and some tests in a more or less realistic environment. That would make a company more willing to invest into something. Picking up the research. So we are closer to application, and this is also what led me basically to this whole founding idea. Because, Fraunhofer in itself is prohibited from commercializing anything. So we are a nonprofit organization. We lose a lot of benefits that we have presently in Germany if we were to commercialize anything, to act like a company on the free market. So whenever Fraunhofer comes up with a technology that they think would be very much applicable to someone, but let's assume... Assume that there's no one who wants to license the patent. Then there's always the possibility... Say OK, I'm going to found a company, my company's going to license Fraunhofer IP and I'm going to make money with it. And this is basically what happened to me. So, My institute has actually a little patent family in a particular field where we thought it would be... Well, a lot of interviews with a lot of companies out there, producers of said product or potential end customers, but a very good feeling about this. And then we thought, well, this is someone... Could lose effectively control over marketing and what happens out there with our ideas. And we wanted to stay in control and the only way was to found... Our own company and... Yeah, my division, the head of my division went about, was looking for... Volunteers. And since I've been working in business development for my institute for quite some time now... I've always had this, this perspective. I've always had a vantage point from which I had a lot of exchange with business developers on the other side. So with people who concern themselves with the question, \"Is anybody going to buy this and why?\" And I thought it would be fun to not only observe this, but to actually do this. And this is how, you know, how I got here.",

But if you look at the actual elements in the in the world of plastics out there for the past, let's say 20, 25 years, then it's pretty obvious that sustainable, more sustainable plastic solutions that just taking crude oil, turning this into polymers, turning this into plastics. 9:56 There's a lot of lot of stuff going on.

Do I take it from your accent correctly that you're from the United States? OK so, from what I perceive personally speaking, generalizing massively. If you found a company in the US and you fail and you found another one and you fail, you are a brave person who is pulling yourself up from the mud and trying again. If you do that in Germany, you're a failure and you're belittled and people always knew that you couldn't make it, so failing as an entrepreneur in Germany, it is a stigma. In the US it's more like OK, we’re going beyond the frontier. And yes, there is the risk of failing, but only the fact that you're trying it makes you a brave person. And this is that will lack in Germany and I think politics could contribute to changing this. To yeah, at least, verbally, vocally being outspoken in a way that only welcome entrepreneurship. That, but if it goes wrong, we're not going to punish you in some way. Yeah, I guess I would agree with you on your assumption. I've also noticed that in Germany it's, you gotta get it right the first time, otherwise it can be difficult. Whereas in the United States, you don’t usually succeed until your 4th or 5th business. Yeah. Exactly. Oh yeah. Well, and since I'm now processing stuff. Something that is difficult for people in Germany who found a business and who are ultimately going to be self-employed is the whole... The whole question of health insurance being an employee in a company and being in one of those statutory health insurances in Germany so much easier than being an Entrepreneur with an unsteady and uncertain income probably being in a private health insurance because you're actively endangering your own well-being. The well-being of your family because it might be that you can't pay your premiums and you're going to lose your health insurance, so generally being employed in Germany is a much, much safer thing than being an entrepreneur. Not only the whole tax business that I referenced to earlier, but also Health insurance or when it comes to paying. I know it's a tax, but it's stuff which is deducted from your income, which is for Social Security. That's it. At least it's in... It's been in an article which are. So so that you're the mind you might be getting and some kind of bill where the government basically tells you look, we found that you haven't been paying stuff or you are going to be paying stuff in advance and we're going to need €100,000 from you right now for Social Security stuff. And that, for a startup, might be the end of your whole business because you haven't got €100,000 lying around.

If we could transform these 40% into a whole economic sector, that would be a huge advantage for the whole country, for the people themselves. We must shift our perspective on what is valuable time—what is time we can refinance, reuse to strengthen our internal market—and use the capacity, the power, the willpower, and the time of people who are already doing this kind of work. We have to give them more credit for what’s happening and use it as an economic market. They can do incredible, incredible stuff. To be honest, what we see in this sector is like a parallel society building up within the whole system. For example, in the public health sector, people don’t find the necessary measures, so they go to private coaches, private healthcare. So it’s a whole other sector, and we could use that to change the perspective on that type of work.",

That's why the election now doesn't really change our business approach or the decision of the election. The tailwind that you might wish for has not materialized. To give you an example, when we founded in 2021 and were still nothing, we still got an appointment with the then Federal Minister of the Interior Seehofer and the State Secretary and administration relatively quickly. We also got an appointment relatively quickly with Mr. Beuth, who was the Minister of the Interior and Administration in Hesse at the time, or with Ms. Milt, NRW and Administration. But the exciting thing is that after the third and fourth meeting, we were asked whether we could make the offer available for major national sporting events or in the federal state of Hesse-Volunteers or NRW-Volunteers, which is of course nonsense. In other words, if you think big, think nationally and set up a digital platform, which of course has no boundaries to a federal state or anything else, it's really challenging. Knowing full well that such an engagement platform and such a digital infrastructure needs many showcases, along types of sport, along areas of engagement, along regions, but the region is probably not Hesse-Volontiers, but perhaps the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region, where we have three federal states, versus Rhine-Main or northern Hesse.

And organized sport is also putting up its own walls. In other words, we now have extensive partnerships with the German Athletics Association, triathlon, swimming and five other associations. But the national elite sports association, USB, we are definitely on the move at divisional manager level, but the management or the board has not yet spoken to us, even though seven or eight people have told them that they should talk to us.

Since 2004 we are using ERDF money from the European Union in combination with money provided by the IBB and since 2022 we also have started an impact fund. So far we had a tech fund. This was what we did since 1997. The classical tech investments in venture capital. And since 2008, we also have an fund for creative industries, because this is an important industry in Berlin.

        "answer": "We are 100% public funded and every Euro that is returned to the fund is invested again. So no private investors, we have to make a happy. We are working for promoting the venture capital and startup ecosystem in in Berlin. And I think it's fitting for a public venture fund not to do just a business promotion, which is of course, the one aim of this venture capital business here, but also look inside the companies what they are they doing with the money and besides creating new jobs in start up companies, can we have an added value with a business model within the company. Added value for society or for the environment and that is the idea behind an impact investing fund. This impact fund is also funded by the European Union, 40% is ERDF and the rest is reflows from the tech and Creative Fund. We are using this reflows to create a new instrument here in Berlin the the Impact Fund. Of course, not every startup we are looking into is suitable for the impact fund that we have. We are investing in base technologies or enabling technologies that you often cannot determine the impact. Because the impact is depending on what is the customer doing with your software technology or whatever or the the impact is only visible in a very long term. And we as a venture fund are usually invested for five, seven, ten years. And if you do for example Biotech drug development, in most cases if the drug is successfully developed, we will sell the company before this is going to the market. So we cannot measure in impact how many people are affected by this drug. We can't measure because we are not a shareholder anymore when the impact is achieved. So it's important to have both, impact fund for startups with measurable impact and tech fund and creativecompanies. So no one nobody is dropping out of adventure financing. Because we we have this broad approach and it makes sense not to just focus on one technology here in Berlin, because we have this strict regional focus. So for a venture fund it is important to have enough deal flow because only two to three percent of the applicants are suitable for venture financing in the end. So the market has to be big enough to place this 120 million Euro.",

So it's five criteria says that are important: First of all, it has to be a real business that is at least in the middle and long term able to generate a profit. This very important. Then the impact has to be integrated into the business model not as an add on impact. For example sell a conventional product and use the revenue to do something else: Plant the three or something like this. The product itself has to generate an impact. This is very important. Then the impact has to be intended. Means for us: the Founders are doing this because of the impact. It's not just a by product for them. And very important is the measurability, so we have to be able to measure the impact. If it's too long term and we can't measure anything, then it's not for the impact fund. Maybe for the tech fund. And a third point is the positive impact has to be much bigger than the negative impact, that are usually connected to every business activity you have. You use resources in the end, and so there's always a negative impact, too. But the positive impact has to be much bigger.",

So this is the first important thing and we look into, what can be measured in this start up regarding the impact. 10:12 Only if these two things are given, then we would put this into the impact fund. If not, it's more omething for the tech fund. And the other things are classical venture due diligence. So how is the potential for scaling, the business is very important, the founding team of course is is very important. Do they have former experiences or how clear is their approach is this. This is a sound approach because we see a lot of businesses. We also have financed over 180 companies in the last more than 20 years.

So it's a very broad scale, not just climate or health. It's a health, climate, education, fight against poverty, sustainability. So it’s a very broad approach.  And in the end you have to identify suitable indicators for each business model. So we don't have a fixed set of of indicators because we don't know yet, what kind of companies we will finance in the end. It's easier if you have just the climate funds and you can measure CO2 equivalents. But as we don't have this narrow focus, which doesn't make sense for us with this strict region of focus, ee don't know the the indicators in advance and you have to find indicators suitable for each and every investment.  And we developed this together with a with the founders. Some already have a kind of a concept. But we do this in the course of the due diligence and there has a lot of work to go into this planning of the impact. And it's not just planning numbers, but also how do you get the data then? In many cases you need quality data. So if you work in your education project, usually you have to do questionnaires. You have to also ask your participants, if you want to know not only how many people have participated in a workshop or something like this, but also did they learn something and did what the learned help them to tackle their problems.

        "answer": "Yeah, what is more and more important, not just for impact investing, but also for the classical investment is the is the ESG topic or is a risk assessment. Are there any negative aspects you should mind when when investing? And this is something we do for for every investment. The startups have to fill out an online questionnaire which is in cooperation with a Berlin based company. […]  So I see a lot of such questionnaires from different different providers. Most of them are not targeted on startup companies, more on older companies where you have to fill in greenhouse gas emissions up to Level 3, which doesn't make much sense for a company with less than 10 employees. If you do a first investment with less than 10 employees, 0 revenues, there's no need to ask them for greenhouse gas emissions. They don't have the numbers and the effort to get these numbers would be too high for not a lot of insight you get.  But to have such a questionnaire is more for us to identify an area where we should have it deeper look. So if a company is producing something physical, then the supply chain might be an important issue. Where are they planning to get their raw material materials from and so on? If this is just a software company, this might be not an issue, but then you have maybe an issue with data protection and so on.  So it's a questionnaire which can be filled out by a founder in 30 minutes to one hour, but he doesn't have to look up numbers. That's important. So just to get a feeling, if there are areas in your diligence, where we should have a deeper look. But this is something that is now quite common to do such ESG assessment also with private funds. So we are not outlier anymore with this.",

Including the impact, the planning, amount we're investing? WWho are the Co-investors? Who are the founders? So everything that is important for the due diligence. Also the criteria that comes from the EU. Also there's this ESG assessment and in case of impact investments, there is a impact planning.

        "answer": "I think there are already a lot of impact startups, but sometimes there are a lot of companies that are generating positive impacts in social economy. In Berlin it is quite a broad space. You often have to explain that that venture capital is like a classic start up area and not for everyone. It's a very small target group that is suitable for venture financing. So in the end the companies have to meet also the venture capital criteria: highly scalable, profit in the end. So we always have to explain a lot, what kind of companies we are looking for, because we need the scaling effect to generate a relevant impact with venture capital and also to generate in the end returns that we are then able to reinvest. And a lot of companies that approach us are not venture suitable. But the good thing is, with the with the Investitionsbank in our back, there are a lot of programmes from the IBB which also are open for for for companies that are not venture companies, but sound businesses. And we can always connect them to the IBB and maybe they get a funding there. That's important. So matching is one topic. What is very interesting for us is with the five investments we have done so far we were able to find new co-investors, that we haven't invested with before. So in many cases impact orientated investors. So it's for us a way also to expand our investor network, that's a side effect. And matchmaking is always a topic.",

        "answer": "Also for classical startups to find an investor, in most cases you have to approach a lot of potential investors and find in the end the consortium. It's the same for us. So if you only invest in two percent and in the end, maybe of the startup companies 20 to 30% get a financing, you have to approach maybe at least 10 to 20 potential investors to to find financing. It's the same for impact startups. But it's I think it's an advantage if you have an impact startup. So there there is not so much competition. So it's something you can put on the table. I would say it's easier for an impact startup to get a financing than a classical tech startup. Maybe because there are not so many impact startups yet. So if you are on this path, it is worth to to put effort in this. It's a additional effort for the startups of course, because they don't have not just a financial business plan but also an impact business plan. So it's additional effort, but it might be worth it because you're can approach additional investors with this concept.",

Well, we never founded the company because it’s too expensive to actually build a GmbH. So we’re still a GbR, with good AGBs hoping that nobody will sue us and we don’t go to jail. Yeah. So we just kept it very small because there’s not a lot of investment happening in this area. And everybody’s like, 'Oh, you’re doing social impact — great — I’m going to share this on LinkedIn, but I’m not going to give you any money.' 3:34 And well, the health system is super complicated, so to work with health insurance you need a lot of money to get to all the standards. And then you develop a product that helps the health insurance but not the actual patients. So I think we kind of always drove with — like we were not very forward. We were very scared of taking too many risks because we knew that it was going to be very, very difficult to get into this area with a business that would actually make enough money — like reading everything about how all the businesses fail and how they make absolutely no money because the health insurance companies have so much power. 4:21 Yeah, once we learned all about that, we were sort of trying not to go into that direction — trying to find other ways — which is super difficult because everyone in Germany expects their health insurance to pay everything, me included.

Nothing’s happening fast. They’re making life so difficult for anyone who wants to build a startup. There’s no money. You can’t survive. You basically don’t even exist. You’re living off so little money. In the end, you are a sozialfall because you don’t earn money. It was super hard for us to get people to come into our startup and work for us because they said, 'On this money I can’t survive.' Or they said, 'OK, I want to work on this project, but I can only do part-time because I need to work somewhere else,' which wasn’t allowed. So there’s a lot that made it super difficult.

I don’t see that anything is changing. Like, I mean, if the UK was still part of the European Union, I would have probably founded a limited with €150. Now I can’t do a lot of things because I’m not an UG, but if I form an UG, I have so many costs that I can’t cover. So I’m trying to have this business on a very — like — everything is very cheap, everything works, but it’s not... yeah. I don’t know. It could be so much easier. Why do I have to go to the notary to build a €1 company and pay €2000 that I don’t have? And then you get the money from EXIST and you can only spend it on this, this, and that. Oh no, that can’t — you can’t spend the money on this. But yeah, I mean, there’s some attorneys who already know, so they kind of write something else in the invoice and then it works. But it’s so complicated. I spend so much time filling out all these papers instead of working on the startup project. And then I’m thinking, OK — they gave us €140,000 or €140,000, which in the end is ridiculous. If you pay four people — you pay four people €140,000 over a year. And then now they’re making it more complicated because the money — now you have to put it in your tax declaration. So it’s even less if you get EXIST in a very... Well, we got it from June to June. So that was perfect because I made so little money that it didn’t go into my tax declaration. But if you get it from January to December, then you get this very little money and you have to pay taxes on it. What? Yeah, that made it super, super frustrating, super difficult, and I don’t understand why things have to be so difficult. In the end, it’s €140,000. They talk about millions and billions going into XYZ. But like, if you really want startups to do stuff, don’t make their life so difficult. They have to learn so many things.

        "answer": "Yeah. OK. What I thought was super complicated was founding a company. Why do I need a notary? Why do I need €1,500 to sign a stupid slip of paper for a company that — I mean — 90% of startups fail? Why does it have to be so complicated? That led us to not found the company, which probably slowed us down in other areas. Why can’t I click a few buttons and have, I don't know, maybe a preliminary company that needs to go to the notary once they pass certain thresholds? I mean, I’m not an expert. I’m just talking about what’s really frustrating. I thought it was super, super difficult to get any money. I’m not going to go to the bank and ask for a loan of half a million euros — even though they say, Oh yeah, we are the startup-friendly bank. Sure, you can borrow half a million — but I have to pay it back with interest. Where am I going to get that money from? Getting money... I mean, the grants are great — I love the grants — but it's very little money. We had the Berlin startup grant, so I had to move to Berlin. I was living in Munich before. I don’t think any other city gives this kind of money. That’s what started this journey, so that was great. I would have given up on the startup idea after half a year had Berlin not had this money — but that meant I had to move to Berlin. They were paying me very little money. I had to pay insurance — which is super expensive because you’re basically voluntarily insured, so I paid so much insurance. After that, we got Exist [startup grant], but we also paid a lot of insurance. We got a bit more money every month, but by then I was already living like a monk. And then you’re supposed to make investments — but they give you €30,000. What am I going to invest in? We have a digital business, so that was easy. We just didn’t do much. We used the cheapest version of everything possible. That also helped us build a very lean product. I’m a techie person, so I just organized everything to be super cheap. But yeah, money was a big issue. There are so many rules and regulations that make it super difficult. Once you understand how difficult it all is, you're already so far advanced that you're like, OK, I’m not going to give up now. But I think if I hadn’t spent that much time understanding all these complicated things — and knowing that if you do this wrong, you could go to jail — that scared me. I'm like, what am I doing? I'm a software developer. I could make, I don’t know, €150,000 had I not tried to build a startup. Basically, if you start a startup, you lose. I feel like you don’t win — because in the end, when you apply for jobs, nobody cares. They also don’t understand what you’ve been doing. I think access to money needs to be less complicated. I also don’t understand why Exist has to be tied to a university degree. Why do I need a university degree to be able to build a startup? That’s stupid. I didn’t learn anything about building a company in my informatics degree. I think that's super unfair. There are clever people who are probably better at business who haven’t gone to university. And that’s the only funding you can actually access. And then — that’s also stupid — you can only apply if you haven’t been out of university for longer than five years. Why? Why? Why? So you need super junior people willing to work for very little money. They come out of university and they're like, What? That’s all I can make? €30,000 a year? And have to pay taxes. If they want companies to grow — because I think people who can build companies are not 20, they're probably 39 or 45. They have experience. They know how to write a business plan. They understand business. They know the right people and they would get a lot farther than someone like me or some of my colleagues who just finished their university degree and have no idea about anything. And just like, Okay, I can work for €30,000 for a year, but then I want more. And if I don't build this company on €30,000 that I can spend, then that's it. Or I find more state investment where I have to fill out some forms and wait for half a year. But until they give me €50,000, where am I going to get the €50,000 from? I don't have them. That's why I need more funding. And yeah, and then it's also difficult in this space to find investors. It's like I don't know. Oh yeah, I remember. There's",

        "answer": "Yeah, I think what I’m always thinking about is there are so many cities — for example, my family’s from Hagen — and Hagen has 10% of the flats sitting empty. Why does everybody who wants to found a startup have to go to Berlin? Berlin is already full. If, for example, you offered people: Okay, you can live for free or your office rent is free for the first five years if you move your company here — if you have your people living in, for example, Hagen, and they only pay €5 rent — that would have motivated me. I would have moved to Hagen because it’s super well connected. And if I can spend very little on my cost of living and have time to build my startup, that’s great. Whereas here in Berlin, everything is super expensive, and I have to worry about what I can afford. I think that would be another idea — aren't there more creative ways of supporting startups? Because in the end, what do I need money for? Health insurance, cost of living. If they told me Okay, we’ll pay your health insurance, and you move to that city, and your rent is €10 a month — I’m going. And I don’t need that much money. And that would also help this area because, in the end, what does Berlin want? Why do they give us the startup grant? Because they want us to create jobs. But these areas also need jobs — and they have all the living space.",

        "answer": "I am a designer in graphic and web design. I studied a long time ago and worked in agencies and marketing for about 25 years. There were personal things happening and I could not deal with the consumption and marketing any longer. I decided to do something better with the rest of my life and not sell people things they do not need or want. The idea for a startup existed for many years. I moved very often because of my freelance work, about 12 times in 20 years, so I know a lot about the housing shortage in Germany. I began to think there must be another way to bring people into a home, not just an apartment, but into a living situation they really live in and like. Nobody needs 100 square meters for themselves, and not everyone is good at living in communities with 20 people. I looked for other solutions to create a modern urban lifestyle that is healthy, sustainable, social in communities, primarily in cities. That was the main idea. It took time to get to a concrete concept or startup idea. In 2019 I attended the first startup event in Innsbruck and presented The Colony as an idea that could be a startup. It was not founded then, but the idea was an urban village with small private spaces and large shared areas. All these ideas of a village where everyone helps each other and shares stuff and ideas that brings people together. Many people liked it from the customer side, not from the financial side. I decided this could be what I want to do for the rest of my life. I founded the company in 2020 during the first lockdown, so really bad timing, but nobody knew that beforehand. This is the story of The Colony. I also work on my lifestyle to live as sustainably as possible. I have been improving myself for the last 12 or 13 years. When you live in the city and you do not own an apartment, a landlord can be difficult. Then you cannot put photovoltaic on the roof or save water.

        "answer": "I cannot say it clearly because in real estate and construction in Germany things take a long time. In marketing things could be done yesterday, now it takes four years which feels eternal. COVID initially slowed things, then the war started and many project developers and construction companies went bankrupt, so there was no income for me. For the last three to four years the only thing I earned was consultancy to convince conventional project developers to build in a more ecological and social way and align with my ideas of a modern urban lifestyle. In the past two years no external funders paid freelancers. We have a 500 billion infrastructure package from the future government, but I fear the money will not be used for the right things. Climate change and saving our environment did not feature in coalition negotiations at first until the Green Party demanded strong commitment. I have heard discussions about nuclear energy and some politicians do not care about our environment. I fear it is getting worse for sustainable projects that are not tech oriented.

        "answer": "Not due to political shifts — more, I’m still not invested, so no venture capital or business angel was helping us. The first two or three years, I was focusing on the community part, bringing people together and operating these communities. We can do that in shopping malls, in old office buildings, in crazy buildings like a bunker. 9:36 It’s not where it is, but how you do it. This is service — a little bit of software, but it’s mainly service. And nobody’s interested in service. Especially German capital loves hardware things they can touch or software as a service. 9:56 If you can scale very fast, then it’s interesting. Or things they can measure, like typical engineer things — there’s a heat pump that’s 3% more efficient than the other. Then — oh, wow, this is pretty cool and rules the world. So this is crazy, and then you get all the money. 10:25 Now, I’m focusing more on product development — that’s what I started with. I switched to service, and now I’m getting back to the beginning. The idea is to bring that tiny house idea into the city. It’s more like a very high-quality, circular-built container thing, but not so small. People in the city don’t accept anything under 15 square meters — that’s too small. 11:01 But anything over 30 square meters, highly functional, built with wood and natural materials, is smart, efficient, and cleverly designed. I think there’s a market — not for a family with three children and two dogs, of course, but for anyone who’s living alone or with a partner because nearly 50% of every citizen lives alone. 11:37 So, it’s a huge market. We can set it up very fast. It’s easier, and the approval process is easier. It can be used temporarily as well. You can address other places for the container buildings, but no one wants to live there. 12:04 We’re making it so you want to live there because it’s really cool and sustainable. We understand the logic of the container buildings, and you can place them on parking decks, in industrial areas, between buildings, and use them for three, four, or five years, and then move them to another place in the city. 12:30 The target group is — government, city, or B2B, like companies for campus situations, employee housing, students, expats, and apprentices. So that’s the main idea. I’m focusing on building that prototype for the Modular House. I hope things will improve with that.",

I fear they’ll deregulate a lot of good things to make it easier and cheaper to build buildings. 14:04 It has to be done so buildings can be built cheaper, but it’s also about fire safety. We have the strongest building regulations in the world here in Germany. Because of the federal system, each state has its own regulations, and nearly every city has its own regulations, so this won’t make it easier. A nationwide standard building law would be very helpful, but I’m not sure if they’ll do it. 14:54 I think they’ll just help the old-school builders to keep making the same stuff they’ve been making since the '80s. It’s not clear at the moment. Everyone involved in real estate and construction, especially those with money, has been standing by since COVID, standing by since the war, and still standing by because they don’t know what the new government will do. 15:28 If they make decisions and the rules are clear, then maybe something could start, but it depends on the ideas they have and the kind of deregulation they plan to do.",

It was supposed to be built circularly, with the highest ecological standards. 16:49 Even though we built a strong concept with these high standards, we could only offer a good yield, about 5-6%, which is great. Four or five years ago in Düsseldorf, everyone would have bought that, regardless of whether it’s ecological or not. 17:25 But I’ve been waiting over three years to find an investor for that project.

I always thought, “Use your brain, talk to the people, and if you see this could be a cool idea with high potential, invest in it.” White papers that do nothing don’t help. There’s no real impact investing in Germany. It’s just Series A and above. If a startup isn’t a startup anymore, if it’s a company and has proven its worth, then they get venture capital. But when it comes to impact investing, they expect the same returns as typical investments, with impact added on top. There’s no compromise. they say, that the higher the potential of that impact is that that company could deliver if it's successful, then we can, maybe we can accept that there's no yield, or just one percent, or there's no exit in the next 10 years. No, the same mechanism on typical venture capital but impact on top. This won’t work.",
